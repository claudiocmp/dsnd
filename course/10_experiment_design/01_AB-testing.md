## AB Testing Example

1. Calculate standard deviation of binomial distribution as

   $\mu = np$

   $\sigma = \sqrt{\mu(1-p)}$

2. Multiply std_dev by z-score to find the margin of error

   $z = 1.96 \cdot \sigma$

   $SE = \sigma z$

3. Compute confidence interval around 0.5

   $CI = (0.5-SE, 0.5+SE)$

4. Verify that the control (or the experimental) group is in a proportion within the CI
